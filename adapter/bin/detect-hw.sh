# Local hardware detection -- finds the Pi's USB camera, the microphone that belongs to it,
# the outage-buffer stick and the isolated CPU cores at every start, instead of scripts
# carrying one Pi's device names. Two uses:
#
#   source "${VMS_HOME}/adapter/bin/detect-hw.sh"   # functions, for the camera scripts
#   adapter/bin/detect-hw.sh --print [cam01]        # report what would be used (LAUNCH.md A9)
#
# Rules, so detection can't quietly pick the wrong device: exactly one match is used;
# none is an error; several is an error that lists them and asks for CAM_MATCH -- never a
# guess. Per-camera overrides live in /etc/adapter/cameras/<mediamtx-path>.env (template:
# config/cameras/cam01.env.example); every choice is logged to stderr, i.e. the journal.
