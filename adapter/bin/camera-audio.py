"""Print a camera's audio settings as shell-sourceable lines.

The producer scripts (stream-cam02.sh, stream-channel.sh) are bash, and the registry is
the single source of truth for whether a camera records audio -- so they need one tiny
lookup at startup rather than a hardcoded pipeline. Usage:

    eval "$(camera-audio.py cam-02)"     # sets AUDIO, AUDIO_CODEC, AUDIO_DEVICE

The pipeline is fixed for the life of a gst-launch process, so this is deliberately read
ONCE at start and never polled: changing the flag takes effect on the next Start. That is
not just an implementation shortcut -- KVS rejects a stream whose fragments change from
video-only to audio+video mid-stream ("Track changes aren't supported", GetClip and
GetHLSStreamingSessionURL both), so flipping this under a running producer would corrupt
the very clips the setting exists to improve.

Failure is deliberately soft: if the registry is unreachable this prints AUDIO=off and
exits 0, so a network blip degrades to today's video-only behaviour instead of leaving
the camera with no producer at all.
