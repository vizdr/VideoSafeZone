# Audio goes into MediaMTX as LPCM, deliberately uncompressed. Encoding it to AAC here
# instead is the obvious move and it is a trap: rtspclientsink payloads AAC as MPEG-4
# LATM, and the round-trip mangles the codec private data into a form KVS will ingest but
# refuses to play back. stream-cam01.sh carries the full account. LPCM at 16 kHz mono is
# 256 kbps over loopback, which costs nothing here and never leaves the Pi.
#
# Guide 18.2 suggests bypassing MediaMTX entirely for A/V; that advice predates MediaMTX
# becoming the hub, and following it now would cost the local preview, the Start/Stop
# layer, and the single-producer-per-camera model. MediaMTX carries two tracks fine.
#
# The microphone is the sound card on the same USB device as $CAM, found through sysfs
# (detect-hw.sh), and addressed by name, never hw:N -- card numbers move on reboot
# (guide 18.1). Matching by USB parent rather than by card name matters: ALSA calls many
# webcams' mics plain "Webcam", so a second camera would make the name ambiguous.
# The PW310 capture device is STEREO-ONLY (ALSA reports CHANNELS: 2, a fixed value not a
# range), so `-c 1` is rejected outright; audioconvert does the downmix instead.
#
# 16 kHz, not 48 kHz, and the reason is not audio quality -- see stream-cam02.sh for the
# full account. Short version: kvssink synthesises the DTS that GStreamer audio buffers
# lack, using a counter SHARED with the video track, so an audio frame rate higher than
# the video frame rate makes the synthesised timestamps run backwards and KVS drops the
# frames. voaacenc emits 1024-sample frames, so frame duration is 1024/rate: at 48 kHz
# that is 21ms against a 66.7ms video frame, which fails; 16 kHz gives 64ms. Verified by
# measurement below, not by theory -- if you change the rate, recount the rejects.
