# Optional audio recording — what was planned, what was built, what it cost

Per-camera, user-selectable audio alongside video, **off by default**, for both `cam-01`
(AVerMedia PW310 USB webcam) and `cam-02` (ONVIF IPC). Delivered in five phases A0–A4,
all complete and live.

Compiled 2026-09-19. **`Demo-AWS-Video-revCosts4.md` §18 is the canonical reference** —
it was rewritten from this work and carries the operational detail. This document is the
record of *how the design was arrived at*, including the two bugs that shaped it and the
claims that had to be withdrawn. `COSTS-1.4.md` §7.3a is authoritative for cost.

**Every row is marked measured or predicted.** Two predictions in this work turned out
wrong in opposite directions (§7), which is why the distinction is kept.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **measured** | observed on the live system, number recorded |
| *predicted* | derived from source or arithmetic; not exercised |

---

## 1. Status

| Phase | Scope | State |
|---|---|---|
| **A0** | Verify capability before touching a pipeline | done |
| **A1** | `cam-02` audio end to end, hardcoded | done |
| **A2** | `cam-01` audio end to end, hardcoded | done |
| **A3** | Registry flag + Lambda + route + both GUIs | done |
| **A4** | Docs, cost model, corrections | done |

Live state: `set-camera-audio` Lambda **Active**, `POST /cameras/audio` deployed to
`prod`, both cameras `audioCapable=true` / `audioEnabled=false`.

| | `cam-01` | `cam-02` |
|---|---|---|
| Source | PW310 mic, ALSA `hw:CARD=Webcam,DEV=0` | camera's own G.711 A-law in RTSP |
| Over RTSP to MediaMTX | **LPCM** 16 kHz mono | G.711 A-law (untouched) |
| AAC encode happens | at the producer | at the producer |
| Delivered | 16 kHz AAC-LC, 32 kb/s | 8 kHz AAC-LC, ~28 kb/s |
| KVS frame rejects | **0** | **0** |
| CPU added | ~+10 pts (publisher +5, producer +7.5) | ~+3 pts |
| Browser-confirmed | yes | yes |

---

## 2. The constraint that shapes everything

**KVS's ingest and playback paths accept different codecs, and ingest is the permissive
one.** Every design decision below follows from this.

`kvssink`'s pad template accepts `audio/mpeg` (AAC), `audio/x-alaw` and `audio/x-mulaw`.
So G.711 goes in without complaint. But `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL` and `GetClip` both
require *"codec private data in the AAC format"*, and reject anything else with
`UnsupportedStreamMediaTypeException` — the documented expectation is codec ID `A_AAC` on
track 2.

G.711 therefore ingests happily, costs `PutMedia`, and fails only when someone tries to
watch it. **Audio is always transcoded to AAC before `kvssink`, on both cameras. There is
no passthrough option even for `cam-02`**, whose audio is already compressed.

This trap fired **three times** in this work, each time in a different disguise:

1. G.711 would ingest and not play (caught by reading the docs first — §3.4)
2. 48 kHz AAC ingested and lost half its frames silently (§4.1)
3. LATM-wrapped AAC ingested perfectly and then refused to serve (§4.2)

It is also why `ffprobe` accepting a stream proves nothing about the cloud path, and why
the cloud path ingesting proves nothing about playback.

## 3. A0 — findings before any pipeline change

The whole point of A0 was to close unknowns cheaply. Three of the five findings changed
the drafted pipelines before a line was written.

### 3.1 `cam-02` is A-law, not μ-law — and ONVIF cannot tell you

**measured.** MediaMTX reports `{"codec":"G711","codecProps":{"muLaw":false,...}}` and
`ffprobe` says `pcm_alaw, 8000 Hz, mono, 64 kb/s`.

ONVIF's enum is just `"G711"` with no law distinction, so the depayloader choice
(`rtppcmadepay`/`alawdec` vs `rtppcmudepay`/`mulawdec`) **cannot** be derived from ONVIF.
The initial draft used the μ-law elements and would have failed to negotiate.

### 3.2 The PW310 microphone is stereo-only

**measured**, from `arecord --dump-hw-params`:

```
CHANNELS: 2                 # a fixed value, NOT a range
RATE: [8000 48000]
FORMAT: S16_LE S24_3LE
```

`arecord -c 1` fails outright with `Channels count non available`, and so does an
`alsasrc` caps filter asking for mono. Capture stereo, downmix in `audioconvert`.

Signal confirmed live rather than assumed — a dead mic still produces a valid WAV:
peak −8.7 dBFS, RMS −27.9 dB, noise floor −36.5 dB, flat factor 0.00.

### 3.3 Both AAC encoders were already installed

**measured.** `voaacenc` (gst-plugins-bad 1.26.2) and `avenc_aac` (gst-libav 1.26.2) are
both present. Guide §18.2's `sudo apt install -y gstreamer1.0-libav` was unnecessary —
see §7.

`voaacenc` is used: lighter on ARM, and its 1024-sample frame size is the fact the whole
sample-rate decision turns on (§4.1).

### 3.4 `kvssink` has audio pads — and wants `stream-format=raw`

**measured**, from `gst-inspect-1.0 kvssink`:

```
SINK template: 'audio_%u'
  audio/mpeg    mpegversion: {2,4}   stream-format: raw
  audio/x-alaw, audio/x-mulaw
```

Two things fall out: the ingest/playback split in §2, and that the pad accepts **only
`raw`** — not the `adts` `aacparse` produces by default. That caps filter does not
negotiate if omitted, and it is invisible until you try.

### 3.5 `cam-02`'s microphone was clipping, and ONVIF cannot fix it

**measured** on raw PCM, before any encoding:

| | at factory gain | after owner reduced gain in the vendor web UI |
|---|---|---|
| Samples pinned at full scale | **723** | **2** |
| Flat factor | 42.27 | 5.11 |
| Peak | −0.14 dBFS | −5.24 dBFS |
| RMS | −14.8 dB | −28.0 dB |

The giveaway is flat factor and peak count, not peak level alone.

**ONVIF has no gain control.** `AudioSourceConfiguration` carries only `Name`, `UseCount`
and `SourceToken` — the schema has no gain field at all. Same shape as the `ActiveCells`
finding (`Camera-Features.md` §4.1): the camera has the control, ONVIF simply does not
expose it, so the vendor web UI is the only route.

Honest caveat on the comparison: RMS fell 13.2 dB but peak only 5.2 dB. A pure gain
reduction moves both equally, so the room was also quieter at the second measurement. The
clipping verdict is robust regardless — peak-count and flat-factor are what decide it —
but the 13 dB cannot all be attributed to the gain change.

`cam-01` has the opposite problem: RMS −40 dB through the cloud path against `cam-02`'s
−15 dB. Genuine signal, just quiet.

### 3.6 A firmware quirk that breaks capability detection

**measured.** `GetAudioEncoderConfigurations()` returns a configuration the camera is not
using:

| Source | Token | UseCount |
|---|---|---|
| `GetAudioEncoderConfigurations()` | `G711A` | **0** |
| Both profiles (MainStream, SubStream) | `G711` | 2 |

Read the audio config **from the profile**. The same object reports its multicast
`IPv4Address` as `http://192.168.178.67:80/onvif/services`, which is not an IPv4 address —
treat this firmware's ONVIF fields as unreliable generally.

---

## 4. The two bugs that shaped the design

Both were silent. Both passed every check short of the specific one that caught them.

### 4.1 The shared-DTS trap — sample rate is not a quality decision

**Symptom:** `cam-02` audio enabled at 48 kHz. Fragments persisted, both tracks appeared
in the HLS manifest, `ffprobe` was happy — and **over half the audio was missing**:
15 kb/s delivered of 32 kb/s sent, with `kvssink` logging `0x30000005` at 1.65/s.

**Cause**, from `gstkvssink.cpp`, `gst_kvs_sink_handle_buffer`:

```c
} else if (!GST_BUFFER_DTS_IS_VALID(buf)) {
    buf->dts = data->last_dts + DEFAULT_FRAME_DURATION_MS * ...;   // 40ms
}
data->last_dts = buf->dts;      // <-- SHARED across video AND audio
```

GStreamer audio buffers carry no DTS (audio has no reordering, so the convention is PTS
only). `kvssink` synthesises one — from a counter **shared between tracks**. Every audio
frame's DTS is therefore derived from the most recent *video* frame, plus 40 ms. If more
than one audio frame falls between two video frames, the synthesised timestamps overrun
the next real video DTS, the sequence goes backwards, and frames are rejected with
`STATUS_CONTENT_VIEW_INVALID_TIMESTAMP`.

`voaacenc` always emits **1024-sample** frames, so frame duration is `1024 / rate`:

> **Audio frame duration must exceed the video frame interval.**
> At 15 fps that is 66.7 ms, so `1024/rate > 0.0667` → **rate below ~15.4 kHz**.

**measured** on `cam-02`, changing nothing but the sample rate:

| Rate | Frame duration | Rejects | Delivered (of 32 kb/s sent) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 48 kHz | 21 ms | **1.65 /s** | 15 kb/s — over half lost |
| 8 kHz (native) | 128 ms | **0** | 27.8 kb/s |

Diagnosed by A/B-ing reject rates against a prediction, **not** by reading DTS values:
`identity silent=false` is a no-op in this GStreamer build and `python3-gi` is not
installed. The mechanism comes from source; the confirmation is that a prediction derived
from it held.

`cam-01` runs 16 kHz (64 ms frames) — marginally inside the limit rather than comfortably.
**If a camera's video frame rate changes, recount the rejects:**

```bash
journalctl -u kvs-cam01.service --since "-60 s" | grep -c 0x30000005   # want 0
```

### 4.2 The LATM codec-private-data trap — where the AAC encode must happen

**Symptom:** `cam-01` with AAC encoded in the publisher and passed through at the
producer — the obvious design, one encode instead of two. `kvssink` ingested it without
complaint (0 rejects, 30 fragments/min persisted). Then:

```
InvalidCodecPrivateDataException: AAC CPD must be of length 2 or 5, but was 4
```

**Cause:** `rtspclientsink` payloads AAC as MPEG-4 **LATM**, and the LATM round-trip
re-wraps the AudioSpecificConfig. Pulled from the live stream, `codec_data` is the 4-byte
`14081fe0` — AAC-LC and 16 kHz correct, but `channelConfiguration=0` plus trailing config
bits, instead of the canonical 2-byte form KVS requires.

`rtspclientsink`'s payloader is a **per-pad property**, so it cannot be forced to
MPEG4-GENERIC from `gst-launch` syntax. A caps filter after `aacparse` does not change the
choice either (tried; MediaMTX still reported `MPEG-4 Audio LATM`).

**Fix:** do not send AAC over RTSP at all. `publish-cam01.sh` sends **LPCM**
(`audio/x-raw,rate=16000,channels=1,format=S16BE`) — 256 kbps over loopback, which never
leaves the Pi — and `stream-cam01.sh` does `rtpL16depay ! audioconvert ! voaacenc !
aacparse`, so `voaacenc`'s own `codec_data` reaches `kvssink` untouched. The same path
`cam-02` already proved.

**Second reason the encode belongs at the producer:** A/V sync. Capturing ALSA directly in
the producer would be simpler and would make audio lead video by `rtspsrc`'s ~200 ms
latency. Routing both tracks through one RTSP session gives them a single timeline.

---

## 5. The pipelines as built

Both split RTP pads by `application/x-rtp,media=...` — linking the branches bare lets
audio mislink into the video depayloader. Both feed `kvssink`'s audio pad
`stream-format=raw` (§3.4).

**`cam-02`** — `adapter/bin/stream-cam02.sh`:
```
src. ! application/x-rtp,media=audio ! queue
  ! rtppcmadepay ! alawdec ! audioconvert
  ! audio/x-raw,rate=8000,channels=1
  ! voaacenc bitrate=32000 ! aacparse
  ! audio/mpeg,mpegversion=4,stream-format=raw ! queue ! kvs.audio_0
```

**`cam-01`** — split across two scripts:
- `publish-cam01.sh`: `alsasrc ! audioconvert ! audioresample !
  audio/x-raw,rate=16000,channels=1,format=S16BE` → MediaMTX
- `stream-cam01.sh`: `rtpL16depay ! audioconvert ! voaacenc bitrate=32000 ! aacparse !
  audio/mpeg,mpegversion=4,stream-format=raw` → `kvs.audio_0`

**With audio off, both pipelines are byte-for-byte the pre-audio ones.** Turning the
setting off is a true revert, not a second code path that resembles one — which matters,
because `cam-01`'s video chain took the `profile=high` bug to get right.

Guide §18.2 previously advised bypassing the RTSP hop entirely and going straight to
`kvssink`. That predates MediaMTX becoming the hub; following it now would cost the local
preview, the Start/Stop layer and the single-producer-per-camera model.

---

## 6. A3 — the user control

Registry-driven, following the `recordingMode` pattern exactly: the `cameras` table is the
single source of truth, both GUIs write the same row.

| Attribute | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `audioCapable` | hardware fact, written at registration |
| `audioEnabled` | the user's choice, **default false** |
| `audioDevice` | `cam-01`: `hw:CARD=Webcam,DEV=0` |
| `audioCodec` | `PCM` / `PCMA` — picks the depayloader |

`adapter/bin/camera-audio.py` prints shell-sourceable env; the pipeline scripts `eval` it
**once at startup**. Failure is deliberately soft — an unreachable registry prints
`AUDIO=off` and exits 0, so a network blip degrades to video-only rather than leaving a
camera with no producer at all.

### 6.1 Why it applies on the next Start

Not a limitation — a requirement. AWS documents, for `GetClip` *and* HLS:

> Track changes aren't supported. […] An error is returned if the fragments in the stream
> change from having only video to having both audio and video.

Applying this to a running producer would break `GetClip` across the boundary — precisely
the clips the setting exists to improve. Hence read-once-at-launch, and both GUIs say
"from the next Start".

### 6.2 Why both APIs refuse it server-side

`set_camera_audio.py` and the admin route both reject `audioEnabled` on a camera whose
`audioCapable` is false, rather than relying on the UI hiding the control. That is not
defensive padding: **`kvssink` collects across its pads**, so an audio pad that never
delivers stalls the *video* too. A 400 is a far better failure than a stalled stream.

### 6.3 Two controls in the UI, not one

They are different things, and merging them misleads:

| | Record the microphone | Play sound in this browser |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | the stream — everyone, every clip | your speakers only |
| When | next Start | instant |
| Cost | bandwidth + CPU | none |

The listen control stays disabled until hls.js reports an audio track in the manifest it
is **actually playing** — read from `MANIFEST_PARSED`, not inferred from the registry
flag, which may have changed since the producer started. The player is created muted
because browsers block unmuted autoplay; unmuting from the checkbox's own handler is
permitted, because the click is the user gesture.

### 6.4 A CSS bug worth recording

The audio checkboxes rendered detached from their labels and overflowing the panel. Cause
was not the new markup but `client/index.html`'s **pre-existing global rule**:

```css
input { display: block; margin: 0.5rem 0; padding: 0.5rem; width: 100%; box-sizing: border-box; }
```

Written for the login form's text fields, it matches every `<input>` on the page; on a
checkbox, `width:100%` makes the box span the panel and shove the label outside. A
`flex: none` fix did nothing, because it touches neither `width` nor `display`.

The first fix attempt treated the symptom. The second only worked because the layout was
then **rendered headlessly through Chromium** — extracting the real CSS and template,
substituting the three states, and looking at the result — rather than reasoned about.

> That rule still applies to any checkbox or radio added anywhere else in this client.
> The real fix is scoping it to `#login input`; not done, because it changes the login
> form's styling as a side effect of an audio feature.

---

## 7. Corrections and withdrawn claims

Five claims in this work were wrong. Recording them is the point.

| Claim | Status | Correction |
|---|---|---|
| Guide §18.3: *"AAC is required; KVS will not accept raw PCM or Opus"* | **refined** | Conclusion right, reasoning incomplete. `kvssink` *does* accept A-law/μ-law **at ingest**; it is the reader APIs that require AAC. Ingest and playback are separate questions. |
| Guide §18.3: *"Audio adds ~64 kbps — negligible against 1.5 Mbps of video"* | **withdrawn** | Both halves wrong. 32 kbps suffices, and "negligible" depends entirely on the stream — see §8. |
| Guide §18.2: `apt install -y gstreamer1.0-libav` | **withdrawn** | Both encoders were already present (§3.3). |
| Draft pipeline: `rtppcmudepay ! mulawdec` for `cam-02` | **withdrawn** | It is A-law (§3.1). Would not have negotiated. |
| Prediction: 16 kHz would be marginal for `cam-01`, ~0.6 rejects/s | **withdrawn** | **measured zero.** The prediction was wrong in the safe direction; 64 ms against a 66.7 ms interval still holds, but the margin is thin — see §4.1. |

One further correction, made in `OUTAGE.md` §3.1 but caused by this work's constraint:
the claim that MediaMTX could not record either camera's audio. fMP4 carries LPCM and
G.711 fine; it was MPEG-TS that could not.

---

## 8. Cost

`COSTS-1.4.md` §7.3a is authoritative. Summary:

Audio is **constant bitrate** — unlike every other term in the cost model, it does not
fall away when the scene is static. So it costs most, proportionally, exactly where video
is cheapest:

| Stream | Video 24/7 est. | +32 kbps | Overhead |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cam-02` sub 640×360 | 0.052 Mbps | 0.084 | **+62 %** |
| `cam-01` 720p, daylight only | 0.241 | 0.273 | +13 % |
| `cam-01` 720p 24/7 | 0.623 | 0.655 | +5 % |
| `cam-02` main 2560×1440 | 1.211 | 1.243 | +3 % |

Absolute cost is unremarkable: 10.4 GB/camera-month, ~$0.10/camera-month at 24/7.

**The `cam-02` sub row matters beyond its own cost.** §6.2 of the cost doc puts the
KVS/S3 crossover at **0.104 Mbps** and that stream sits at 0.052 — comfortably where KVS
wins. Audio moves it to 0.084: still below the crossover, but most of the margin gone.
Audio on a sub-stream is not a rounding error in that argument.

CPU is not free either, and is asymmetric:

| | before | after | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cam-02` producer (was pure passthrough) | ~0 % | 2.5–4 % | +3 pts |
| `cam-01` publisher | ~10 % | ~15 % | +5 pts |
| `cam-01` producer | — | ~7.5 % | +7 pts |

`cam-02`'s producer stops being a pure passthrough the moment audio is enabled — the
property guide §16.3(b) exists to protect.

---

## 9. Known limitations

**The local admin preview never has audio, and that is correct.** It plays MediaMTX's own
HLS, and neither track it receives can enter an HLS manifest — `cam-01` publishes LPCM,
`cam-02` publishes G.711. MediaMTX drops them from the playlist (`CODECS="avc1.640028"`,
video only) rather than producing something broken. **measured**, and a frame decoded to
confirm it was not merely a 200. This is why there is no listen control in the admin GUI:
there would be nothing to listen to.

**`cam-01`'s microphone is quiet** — RMS −40 dB through the cloud path against `cam-02`'s
−15 dB. Real signal, not silence, but the opposite problem from §3.5.

**A `GetClip` window straddling a toggle will fail** (§6.1). `LIVE` HLS self-heals within
a few fragments.

**Two-way audio is out of scope.** `cam-02` exposes audio *outputs* (`AudioMainToken`);
that is a separate feature.

---

## 10. Before enabling this on a real space

Recording the **non-public spoken word** in Germany is **`§201 StGB` — a criminal
offence**, and a stricter regime than the GDPR questions the video already raises.

This is why the default is off, per camera, and opt-in, and why that default is enforced
in the registry rather than only in the UI.

---

## 11. Verification

Every failure mode above was silent at the level of "no pipeline errors". Do not stop
there.

```bash
# 1. tracks reach MediaMTX
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9997/v3/paths/get/cam01 | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A3 tracks2

# 2. no frames being rejected  (want 0 -- anything above is the shared-DTS trap)
journalctl -u kvs-cam01.service --since "-60 s" | grep -c 0x30000005

# 3. the cloud can actually SERVE it -- the step that catches CPD errors
EP=$(aws kinesisvideo get-data-endpoint --stream-name cam-01 \
       --api-name GET_HLS_STREAMING_SESSION_URL --query DataEndpoint --output text)
URL=$(aws kinesis-video-archived-media get-hls-streaming-session-url \
       --endpoint-url "$EP" --stream-name cam-01 --playback-mode LIVE \
       --query HLSStreamingSessionURL --output text)
ffprobe "$URL"                       # expect BOTH streams

# 4. the audio is real, and none of it was dropped
ffmpeg -i "$URL" -t 20 -c copy -y /tmp/s.mp4
ffmpeg -i /tmp/s.mp4 -vn -af astats=metadata=1 -f null - 2>&1 | grep -E 'RMS|Flat'
#    delivered kb/s should match the configured bitrate; about half means the DTS trap

# 5. finally, a BROWSER -- MSE is stricter than ffmpeg and has caught two
#    regressions here that ffmpeg passed
```

Results at delivery: `cam-01` 16 kHz AAC at exactly 32 kb/s with a 45.88 s `GetClip`;
`cam-02` 8 kHz AAC at 27.8 kb/s with a 44.93 s `GetClip`; zero rejects on both; both
confirmed audible in the browser by the owner.
