# FoundAndFixed.md — every defect found in this project, and what fixed it

The single place where this project's bugs are written up: what broke, how it was found,
why it happened, and what fixed it. Other documents keep only the rule or decision a bug
produced, plus a reference to it here — **`FoundAndFixed.md #N`**. Numbers are permanent:
new entries are appended, and an entry is never renumbered or reused.

**In scope:** defects in this project's own code, configuration, build and setup, and
documentation (an instruction that fails when followed is a defect too). **Not here,
deliberately:** quirks of third-party components, which this project works around but
cannot fix (the camera firmware in `Camera-Features.md` and `AUDIO.md` §3, the `kvssink`
buffer behaviour in guide §16.3c), withdrawn *predictions* (`AUDIO.md` §7), and generic
advice (guide §15 "Known traps").

### What they have in common

- **Most were silent.** #5, #7, #13, #15, #16, #18, #20, #21, #32, #36, #37 and #39 all
  passed "it ran without errors". The recurring cause is a tool that reports success on
  the wrong question. `systemctl is-active` says `inactive` for a unit that doesn't exist
  (#7, #37). `check=False` swallows a failure (#7). `ffmpeg` plays what a browser won't
  (#13). KVS ingest accepts what KVS playback refuses (#16). `sudo -n` passes on a cached
  password (#34). CLAUDE.md "Verifying changes" is the countermeasure.
- **Ingest is more permissive than playback** (#13, #15, #16, #19): verify at the
  consuming end — a decoded frame, a browser, `GetHLSStreamingSessionURL` — not at
  ingest.
- **Two copies of one fact drift** (#7, #25, #30, #31, #37): unit names, paths, endpoints
  and camera addresses now each have one source (CLAUDE.md "Paths", the registry,
  `/etc/adapter/`).
- **Instructions are code too.** #24–#30, #33–#34, #38 and #40 were wrong or missing
  documentation. They surfaced only when the setup was followed literally on a fresh Pi.
- **A 4 GB Pi building C/C++** (#1–#4) needs memory discipline at every level of a
  nested build, not just the top one.

---

## Build and platform

### #1 — The Pi crashed outright during the SDK build — three mechanisms

**Found:** 2026-08-20, over five failed build attempts. **Referenced from:** guide §1.4, §4.

A Pi 4B running VS Code Remote-SSH's server (1.3+ GB of Node processes) plus a
from-source C++ build is oversubscribed on 4 GB. The KVS SDK build did not just fail — it
took the whole Pi down, by three distinct mechanisms:

- **Kernel OOM with no early intervention.** An `earlyoom` setting of `-s 50` (act only
  once swap is *also* below 50 % free), tried to rescue large compiles, let available
  memory crater from 64 % to 12 % in one 60-second window before it acted — a full crash.
- **Swap thrashing on the SD card.** Once, mid-build: no OOM-killer log, no panic, a
  silent cutoff correlated with `brcmfmac` (WiFi) SDIO timeouts just before it.
- **Build load on the interrupt cores.** This kernel isolates cores 1–2
  (`isolcpus=1,2 irqaffinity=0,3`); an unpinned build competed with WiFi interrupt
  servicing. `systemd-run --property=AllowedCPUs=` silently did nothing (cpuset not
  delegated to user cgroups).

Firmware was also found over a year out of date (EEPROM 2025-05-08 vs 2026-05-17).

**Fix:** guide §1.4's four hardening steps — `earlyoom -m 20 -s 95` preferring compiler
processes; a low-priority disk swapfile with `vm.swappiness=10`; EEPROM update; `taskset
-c 1,2` for the build. The final build ran with zero crashes and zero `earlyoom`
interventions. (On the second Pi, `isolcpus` is not set — `detect-hw.sh --print`
reports it — so the pinning protects nothing there.)

### #2 — Nested `--parallel` in the SDK ignores `-j1` and `PARALLEL_BUILD`

**Found:** 2026-08-20; recurred 2026-09-24 on the second Pi. **Referenced from:** guide
§4.2, LAUNCH.md A3, README §3.

`CMake/Utilities.cmake`'s `build_dependency()` builds each dependency with `cmake --build
. --parallel`, no job count — a bare `--parallel` becomes `-j$(nproc)` and overrides any
inherited `MAKEFLAGS`. `-DPARALLEL_BUILD=OFF` fixes the top-level copy (log4cplus dropped
from **370 → 14** concurrent tasks). But OpenSSL is built by a **nested** vendored copy,
`dependency/libkvscproducer/kvscproducer-src/CMake/Utilities.cmake`, which hardcodes
`--parallel` with no option at all: OpenSSL still spawned **398 tasks** and crashed the Pi.

**Recurrence, 2026-09-24:** on the second Pi the patch was not applied (#24), so OpenSSL
again compiled one job per core; `earlyoom` (configured by #1 to prefer compilers) sent
SIGTERM to every `cc1` at once — `build.log` showed a burst of `cc: fatal error:
Terminated signal terminated program cc1` and `EXIT_CODE=1`. Nothing was wrong with the
code.

**Fix:** patch 1 — `sed -i 's/--build \. --parallel/--build ./'` on the nested file
(LAUNCH.md A3). With it the 2026-09-25 build ran at 14 tasks, zero `earlyoom` kills.

### #3 — OpenSSL's test submodules crashed the Pi during clone

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §4.2, LAUNCH.md A3.

OpenSSL's `ExternalProject_Add` also fetched four large optional submodules (`boringssl`,
`krb5`, `pyca-cryptography`, `wycheproof` — fuzzing and test vectors, not needed for
`make install_sw`). Cloning `boringssl` alone caused repeated system crashes during
clone/checkout — most likely sustained SD-card I/O pressure, the same failure mode as
#1's swap thrashing.

**Fix:** patch 2 — `GIT_SUBMODULES ""` in the `project_libopenssl` block.

### #4 — GCC 14 rejects the SDK's implicit `pthread_getname_np`

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §4.2, LAUNCH.md A3.

`Thread.c` in kvspic uses `pthread_getname_np`, a GNU extension that needs `_GNU_SOURCE`
defined before `<pthread.h>`. Older GCC only warned about the implicit declaration;
**GCC 14 made it a hard error**, so the build fails outright on Debian trixie.

**Fix:** patch 3 — `add_definitions(-D_GNU_SOURCE)` (under `UNIX AND NOT APPLE`) in
kvspic's `CMakeLists.txt`, once, globally. Its file only exists after the configure step
has downloaded kvspic (#24).

### #33 — The journal lived in RAM only, and the first fix didn't take on Pi OS

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** LAUNCH.md A1.

The second Pi kept the journal in `/run/log/journal` only. Every reboot lost all logs —
so the first failed build (#2) left no trace across the reboot — and `journalctl --user
-u <unit>` printed "No journal files were found" for **every** user unit, which every
`--user -u` check in LAUNCH.md depends on.

The first fix (`mkdir /var/log/journal`) did nothing: Raspberry Pi OS ships
`/usr/lib/systemd/journald.conf.d/40-rpi-volatile-storage.conf` with
`Storage=volatile` (to spare the SD card), which makes journald ignore the directory.
(A related misreading: an empty `/var/log/journal` was first reported as missing.)

**Fix:** a later drop-in, `/etc/systemd/journald.conf.d/90-vms-persistent.conf`, with
`Storage=persistent`, `SystemMaxUse=200M`, `SystemMaxFileSize=20M`, then `journalctl
--flush`. Verified: `system.journal` and `user-1000.journal` on disk, the pre-switch boot
still listed, `journalctl --user -u` works.

### #34 — Passwordless sudo assumed; the check was fooled by a cached password

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** LAUNCH.md A8.

`agent.py`/the admin GUI run `sudo systemctl start|stop` and `sudo provision-camera.sh`
with no terminal. The code and docs assumed Raspberry Pi OS grants passwordless sudo; the
current image grants `(ALL : ALL) ALL` with a password. Worse, LAUNCH A8's check `sudo -n
true` **passed**: this image sets `Defaults timestamp_type=global`, so a password typed
anywhere in the last ~15 minutes satisfies `sudo -n` in every session — services
included. Start/Stop would have worked just after any `sudo`, and failed otherwise.

**Fix:** `/etc/sudoers.d/020_vms-adapter`, NOPASSWD for exactly `systemctl
start|stop kvs-cam(@cam)?NN.service` and `provision-camera.sh cam-NN camNN` (regex
arguments, sudo ≥ 1.9.10), validated by `visudo` before install. The check is now `sudo
-k -n` (ignores the cache). Verified allowed and refused cases, including a smuggled
second unit.

## Media pipeline and audio

### #5 — The camera chain was never persisted; the producer crash-looped silently

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §2.8, §7.1, LAUNCH.md Part B.

Hours into later phases, the stream was dead — not downstream: `camera-init.sh` →
MediaMTX → `publish-cam01.sh` had only ever been run by hand, never made into units. The
cloud-facing pieces (`kvs-cam01.service`, the agent) were persisted and auto-recovering,
so `kvs-cam01.service` crash-looped (`Restart=on-failure`) against a 404 on
`rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/cam01`, with nothing to show for it. A later version of LAUNCH
Part B repeated it: `kvs-camera-publish` was missing from the launch list and everything
else came up "active".

**Fix:** user units for all three pieces (`kvs-camera-init`, `kvs-mediamtx`,
`kvs-camera-publish`), in the launch list, and the rule that `is-active` is not proof —
verify media (LAUNCH.md Part C).

### #13 — `v4l2h264enc` negotiated Baseline; browsers rendered black

**Found:** date not recorded. **Referenced from:** README "Results", CLAUDE.md, guide
§2.6, `AUDIO.md` §5, `OUTAGE.md` §4.1.

`/dev/video11`'s `h264_profile` control defaults to High, but GStreamer's `v4l2h264enc`
negotiated **Baseline** — nothing in the pipeline asked for it. `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` played
the stream; browsers (MSE) rendered **black**. The guide's Checkpoint 1 even recorded
`Video: h264 (Baseline)` and called Baseline "the safer choice" — the note that let the
bug pass.

**Fix:** `profile=(string)high` in the encoder caps in `publish-cam01.sh`, and the rule
to finish every pipeline check in a browser with a decoded frame (CLAUDE.md "Verifying
changes"). Re-verified 2026-09-25 on the second Pi: `H.264 High, level 4.0`.

### #15 — 48 kHz audio silently lost more than half its frames (shared DTS)

**Found:** during the audio work (`AUDIO.md`). **Referenced from:** guide §18.3,
`AUDIO.md` §2/§4.1, README, CLAUDE.md.

*Symptom:* cam-02 audio at 48 kHz — fragments persisted, both tracks in the HLS
manifest, `ffprobe` happy — and over half the audio missing: **15 kb/s delivered of
32 kb/s sent**, `kvssink` logging `0x30000005` at 1.65/s.

*Cause* (`gstkvssink.cpp`, `gst_kvs_sink_handle_buffer`): GStreamer audio buffers carry no
DTS, and `kvssink` synthesises one as `last_dts + 40 ms` from a counter **shared with the
video track**. With more than one audio frame between two video frames, the synthesised
timestamps overrun the next video DTS, go backwards, and are rejected
(`STATUS_CONTENT_VIEW_INVALID_TIMESTAMP`). `voaacenc` emits 1024-sample frames, so frame
duration is `1024/rate`: 21 ms at 48 kHz against a 66.7 ms video frame.

*Diagnosed* by A/B-ing reject rates against a prediction derived from the source —
`identity silent=false` is a no-op in this GStreamer build and `python3-gi` is not
installed, so DTS values could not be read directly.

| Rate | Frame duration | Rejects | Delivered (of 32 kb/s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 48 kHz | 21 ms | **1.65 /s** | 15 kb/s — over half lost |
| 8 kHz (native) | 128 ms | **0** | 27.8 kb/s |

**Fix:** the rule *audio frame duration must exceed the video frame interval* — below
~15.4 kHz at 15 fps. cam-02 runs 8 kHz, cam-01 16 kHz (64 ms: marginally inside, measured
zero rejects). Re-count rejects whenever a camera's frame rate changes (guide §18.3).

### #16 — AAC over RTSP became LATM: ingested, then refused at playback

**Found:** during the audio work. **Referenced from:** `AUDIO.md` §2/§4.2, README,
CLAUDE.md, guide §18.4 (the rule; `stream-cam01.sh`/`publish-cam01.sh` comments retell the story).

*Symptom:* cam-01 with AAC encoded in the publisher and passed through at the producer —
the obvious design, one encode. `kvssink` ingested it (0 rejects, 30 fragments/min), then
playback failed: `InvalidCodecPrivateDataException: AAC CPD must be of length 2 or 5, but
was 4`.

*Cause:* `rtspclientsink` payloads AAC as MPEG-4 **LATM**, and the LATM round-trip
re-wraps the AudioSpecificConfig into the 4-byte `14081fe0` (`channelConfiguration=0` plus
trailing bits) instead of the canonical 2 bytes. The payloader is a per-pad property, not
settable from `gst-launch`; a caps filter after `aacparse` didn't change it (MediaMTX still
reported `MPEG-4 Audio LATM`).

**Fix:** never send AAC over RTSP. `publish-cam01.sh` sends LPCM (16 kHz mono S16BE,
loopback only); `stream-cam01.sh` encodes (`rtpL16depay ! audioconvert ! voaacenc !
aacparse`) so `voaacenc`'s own `codec_data` reaches `kvssink`. Encoding at the producer
also keeps both tracks on one RTSP timeline for A/V sync.

## Control plane and systemd

### #6 — A retained Last Will gets the MQTT CONNECT rejected

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §7.2.

`retain=True` on the agent's Last Will made AWS IoT drop the connection at CONNECT —
`AWS_ERROR_MQTT_UNEXPECTED_HANGUP`, no CONNACK error code — while the same certificate,
policy and topic worked for a normal `publish()`. IoT Core evidently authorizes retained
LWTs more strictly than regular publishes.

*Isolated* by stripping the connection to nothing (no Will, no subscribe), then adding
pieces back one at a time until the failing one was obvious; `awscrt.io.init_logging(
awscrt.io.LogLevel.Debug, 'stderr')` is what surfaces the hang-up's context.

Found alongside: `conn.publish(...)` returns a **tuple** `(future, packet_id)` in
`awsiotsdk` 1.31.0 / `awscrt` 0.36.1 — `.result()` without `[0]` silently swallowed
publish errors.

**Fix:** `retain=False` on the Will (enough — subscribers still see it fire), and `[0]`
before `.result()`.

### #7 — `agent.py` built `kvs-cam-02.service` and silently did nothing for cam-02

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §16.3(a), CLAUDE.md,
`camera_control.py`.

`agent.py` built the unit name as `f"kvs-{camera}.service"`, which for `cam-02` gave
`kvs-cam-02.service` — a unit that doesn't exist (the unit is `kvs-cam02.service`).
`systemctl` exited non-zero, but it was called with `check=False`, so the failure was
swallowed and the API reported success. Caught only by reading `journalctl` and seeing
the wrong unit name in the logged `sudo` command.

**Fix:** `camera_control.mediamtx_path_name()`/`unit_name()` as the one place the
`cam-02` → `cam02` conversion happens. (Its template-unit blind spot is #37.)

### #12 — A system unit declared a dependency on a user unit

**Found:** date not recorded. **Referenced from:** CLAUDE.md.

A templated system unit (`kvs-cam@.service`) declared `Requires=kvs-mediamtx.service`,
which is a **user** unit. System and user units belong to independent systemd instances,
so the system manager could not find it: "Unit not found".

**Fix:** drop the cross-manager dependency. A unit in one manager can never
`Requires=`/`After=` a unit in the other.

### #30 — Six unit files existed only on the old Pi; the `kvs-cam@` sketch was incomplete

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** LAUNCH.md A8, guide §16.6.

LAUNCH Part B enabled units that nothing in the docs created. Only five units were
written out in the guide; `kvs-cam02`, `kvs-agent`, `onvif-admin`, `kvs-event-watcher`,
`kvs-outage-buffer` and `kvs-outage-uploader` existed only as files on the old Pi. The
guide's `kvs-cam@.service` sketch also lacked `User=` and the
`GST_PLUGIN_PATH`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` lines, so every GUI-provisioned producer would have
failed with `No such element "kvssink"`.

**Fix:** LAUNCH.md A8 generates all 13 units (the missing six reconstructed from the code)
with this clone's literal paths, plus checks. Verified with `systemd-analyze verify`.

### #36 — Admin GUI rollback deleted a MediaMTX path with `POST` — a 404, silently

**Found:** 2026-09-25, while testing camera re-matching. **Referenced from:** CLAUDE.md.

When provisioning failed during registration, `app.py` rolled back the MediaMTX path it
had just added with `requests.post(".../v3/config/paths/delete/...")`. MediaMTX's delete
route only accepts `DELETE` and answers `POST` with `404 page not found`; the response
was never checked, so a failed registration always left an orphan path.

**Fix:** `requests.delete(...)`. Verified: the path is gone after a simulated
provisioning failure, and nothing is written to the registry.

### #37 — Start/Stop and status silently no-op'd for every GUI-registered camera

**Found:** 2026-09-25, while writing the sudo rule (#34). **Referenced from:**
`camera_control.py`, CLAUDE.md.

`camera_control.unit_name()` always returned `kvs-camNN.service`, but cameras registered
through the admin GUI run as template instances, `kvs-cam@camNN.service`
(`provision-camera.sh` enables that name). Start/Stop (agent and both GUIs), the status
column and the outage buffer's "is the producer running" check all targeted a unit that
doesn't exist. `systemctl is-active` printed `inactive` for it — the same word as for a
real stopped unit — so nothing looked wrong. Only cam-01/cam-02, which have their own
units, worked. It is #7's pattern again.

**Fix:** `unit_name()` returns `kvs-cam@<path>.service` when
`/etc/adapter/channels/<path>.env` exists — the file `provision-camera.sh` writes for
exactly those cameras — and `kvs-<path>.service` otherwise. Verified against systemd's
`LoadState` (`not-found` before, `loaded` after); the sudo rule (#34) already allowed both
forms.

---

## Cloud client and Lambdas

### #8 — A Lambda exception reached the browser as a bare `NetworkError`

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §8.6.

Pressing Start or reloading sometimes showed `NetworkError when attempting to fetch
resource`. `get_hls_url.py` attached its CORS header only on its own `return`; when
`get_hls_streaming_session_url` raised `ResourceNotFoundException` (producer not running),
the exception escaped, API Gateway returned its own 502 **without CORS headers**, and the
browser could not read the cross-origin response at all — `fetch()` threw instead of
resolving. `curl` cannot reproduce this (it ignores CORS), so backend tests passed.

**Fix:** wrap each handler in `try`/`except` and return every path — 200, 503 "stream is
not currently live — press Start", 500 — through the code that attaches CORS headers.
Applied to both Lambdas.

### #9 — `mediaSourceRequiresReset` on every player reload

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §8.6.

The client's `load()` created a fresh `new Hls()` per call and attached it to the same
`<video>` without releasing the previous instance's `MediaSource` — two overlapping
`MediaSource` objects on one element, which is exactly what the error means.

**Fix:** keep the instance in a module-level variable; `hls.destroy()` before creating
the next.

### #10 — The player retried forever after Stop, with no "stopped" state

**Found:** 2026-08-20. **Referenced from:** guide §8.6.

hls.js's recommended fatal-error recovery (`hls.startLoad()` on `NETWORK_ERROR`) is right
for a live stream's transient blips, but after Stop the stream had ended permanently and
the retry never finished. Even once retries stopped, the viewer saw a frozen last frame
under a spinner — indistinguishable from "still loading".

**Fix:** a `userStopped` flag checked before any retry; Stop tears the player down at
once (`hls.destroy()`, clear `src`); a state-driven overlay ("Stream stopped. Press Start
to watch again." / "Starting stream…"), cleared on `Hls.Events.FRAG_BUFFERED`. The video
wrapper needs `aspect-ratio: 16 / 9`, or the overlay collapses before first load.

### #11 — Browsers kept serving a stale client after deploys

**Found:** date not recorded. **Referenced from:** guide §8.5.1, CLAUDE.md.

After `aws s3 cp` of a new `client/index.html`, browsers kept serving the old page from
cache (S3 static website), so a fix appeared not to work.

**Fix:** every client upload sets `--cache-control "no-cache, must-revalidate"`. Behind
CloudFront the same header makes it revalidate (`x-cache: RefreshHit`), so an upload is
live immediately without `create-invalidation`.

### #14 — HLS sessions died after exactly five minutes

**Found:** 2026-09-06. **Referenced from:** guide §8.6.

A few minutes into watching, the browser's buffering ring appeared and never went away,
while the backend was entirely healthy. Three links in a chain:

1. `get_hls_url.py` requested `Expires=300` — the KVS minimum — so every session URL was
   dead after five minutes regardless of stream health.
2. The client received `expires_in` and never used it.
3. The fatal-`NETWORK_ERROR` branch called `hls.startLoad()`, which re-requests the
   **same** expired URL — a loop that cannot succeed — and showed no overlay, so it looked
   exactly like normal buffering.

*Proved, not inferred:* poll the master playlist every 30 s — `200` at t=+270 s, `403` at
t=+300 s, to the second; the fixed Lambda's URL still `200` at t=+385 s.

It surfaced on cam-02 first only because cam-02's fragments are 2.93 s against cam-01's
1.93 s (the camera's keyframe interval), leaving less headroom at the live edge — "only on
camera X" meant "camera X is the most sensitive detector".

**Fix:** `Expires=3600`; the client refreshes at 80 % of `expires_in`; the error handler
allows two `startLoad()` retries for real blips, then fetches a **new** session behind a
"Reconnecting…" overlay.

### #17 — A global `input` CSS rule broke the audio checkboxes

**Found:** during the audio work. **Referenced from:** `AUDIO.md` §6.4.

The audio checkboxes rendered detached from their labels and overflowing the panel. Not
the new markup: `client/index.html`'s pre-existing global rule `input { display: block;
width: 100%; … }`, written for the login form, matches every `<input>`; on a checkbox,
`width: 100%` spans the panel and pushes the label out. A `flex: none` attempt did nothing
(it touches neither `width` nor `display`). The working fix came only after rendering the
layout headlessly in Chromium instead of reasoning about it.

**Status:** fixed for the audio controls. **Still open:** the rule itself should be scoped
to `#login input`; not done, because it changes the login form's styling as a side effect.

## Outage buffering

### #18 — The guide's outage test (§10.2) could not detect anything

**Found:** first executed while building durable outage buffering. **Referenced from:**
guide §10.2, `OUTAGE.md` §1.2/§7.

Three independent faults, each enough on its own:

1. The `iptables` snippet is IPv4-only. This LAN is dual-stack and AWS resolves to
   `2a05:d014:…`, so every "blocked" connection went over IPv6 and returned HTTP 200 —
   with the rules apparently applied and packet counters even incrementing.
2. 120 s is exactly `kvssink`'s own `DEFAULT_BUFFER_DURATION_SECONDS`, so KVS lost nothing
   and the test proved nothing about buffering.
3. The suggested grep (`retry|reconnect|error`) matches none of the lines that show a
   buffer filling (`droppedFrame`, `storage overflow`, `Overall storage byte size`).
   The test had also never been run: its results file did not exist.

Found while fixing it: **blocking a resolved IP is useless** — the IoT endpoint rotated
through `18.196.251.80`, `3.69.141.146`, `18.185.210.34` and `18.153.244.214` within
minutes, so only blocking AWS *ranges* (`3/8, 18/8, 35/8, 52/8, 54/8`, `2a05::/16`) works.

**Fix:** `adapter/bin/awsblock.sh` (IPv4 + IPv6 ranges, verifies the block landed), outages
well past 120 s, and the method recorded in `measurements/reconnect_timeline.md`.

### #19 — The §17/M1 spec's MPEG-TS recording would have been mute

**Found:** during the outage-buffer design. **Referenced from:** `OUTAGE.md` §1.3/§3.1.

One of two earlier outage-recording specs recorded to MPEG-TS. MediaMTX's MPEG-TS
recorder cannot carry LPCM or G.711 — cam-01's and cam-02's audio on the MediaMTX leg —
so it would have recorded silently mute footage (the ingest-permissive/playback-strict
pattern again).

**Fix:** never built that way; `recordFormat: fmp4` is mandatory (`mediamtx_api.py`).

### #20 — Segment names parsed as UTC: the rolling buffer grew without bound

**Found:** outage-buffer testing (B1). **Referenced from:** `OUTAGE.md` §5.2.

`recordPath`'s `%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S` is formatted in the machine's local zone; parsing it as
UTC put every segment two hours in the future on a CEST box, so the retention cutoff never
matched. Measured 9 segments where 4–5 were expected — it would have filled the stick
silently.

**Fix:** parse with `astimezone()`, with an mtime fallback so an unparseable name can
never become un-prunable.

### #21 — The supervisor blocked 45 minutes on AWS, during the outage it watches for

**Found:** outage-buffer testing (B1). **Referenced from:** `OUTAGE.md` §5.2.

`load_registry()` called DynamoDB on the tick path with boto3's defaults (60 s connect /
60 s read, with retries). With AWS unreachable the process sat in `poll_schedule_timeout`
for **45 minutes**, never reaching the connectivity check — never detecting the outage.

**Fix:** all AWS access moved to a background thread (the tick loop makes no network call),
and the scan pinned to `connect_timeout=3, read_timeout=5, max_attempts=1`.

### #22 — Recovery on a single probe made the supervisor flap

**Found:** outage-buffer testing (B1). **Referenced from:** `OUTAGE.md` §5.2 (`outage_buffer.py`'s
comment retells it).

The IoT endpoint's DNS rotates across AWS ranges; one rotation briefly landed on a
reachable address and the supervisor declared recovery — finalising the capture and
opening another. Measured 3 finalise/reopen cycles within one outage, fragmenting it into
separate clips.

**Fix:** asymmetric thresholds — 2 consecutive failures to declare an outage, 3
consecutive successes to declare recovery. Acting early on failure is cheap; acting early
on recovery stops recording.

### #23 — The reachability probe cost twice its timeout

**Found:** outage-buffer testing (B2). **Referenced from:** `OUTAGE.md` §5.3.

`socket.create_connection` applies its timeout per resolved address, and the IoT endpoint
has A and AAAA records, so `PROBE_TIMEOUT = 4` cost 8 s per probe. Two probes made
detection 86 s against a 120 s pre-roll — working, on a third of the intended margin, and
at the mercy of how many addresses DNS returns.

**Fix:** an explicit resolve-then-try loop under a total `PROBE_BUDGET_SEC = 4`. Measured
0.02 s reachable, hard-capped 4 s unreachable.

## Setup, documentation and repository (second Pi, 2026-09-24/25)

### #24 — LAUNCH A3's patches were not actionable, and patch 3 can't be applied up front

**Found:** 2026-09-24, when the build failed (#2 recurrence). **Referenced from:**
LAUNCH.md A3, README §3, guide §4.2.

LAUNCH A3 listed the three SDK patches only as comments inside a code block, so the build
was started without them. README showed a one-command `cmake … && make` build. And patch
3's target file (`kvspic-src/CMakeLists.txt`) does not exist until the configure step has
downloaded kvspic, while `Thread.c` compiles only later in `make` — so "apply all three
patches first" was impossible as written.

**Fix:** A3 as runnable commands with a proof after each step, and two stages: patches
1–2 → `cmake` configure → patch 3 → `make -j1`. The 2026-09-25 build ran this way in 16
minutes with zero `earlyoom` kills.

### #25 — Absolute `/home/vladimir/MyProjects/VMS` paths broke when the clone moved

**Found:** 2026-09-24. **Referenced from:** CLAUDE.md "Paths", guide §1.3, LAUNCH.md A2.

Seventeen hardcoded paths across 11 files in `adapter/` (certificates, venv, WSDL
directory, helper scripts), plus the docs' `VMS_HOME` exports and systemd examples, still
named the old Pi's clone location. Nothing could find its files in
`~/Projects/VideoSafeZone`. The venv's `python3.13` directory was spelled out too.

**Fix:** code resolves `$VMS_HOME` if set, else the repo root from its own location;
the venv's `pythonX.Y` comes from `sys.version_info`. Units get literal paths generated
per clone (#30). Deployment identity moved to `/etc/adapter/adapter.env` in the same
spirit.

### #26 — The MediaMTX release tarball overwrites the project's `mediamtx.yml`

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** guide §2.5, LAUNCH.md A5.

The documented `tar xzf mediamtx.tar.gz` extracts the release's default `mediamtx.yml`
over the tracked, customised one — silently: MediaMTX starts fine without the project's
settings. LAUNCH A5's proof ("`git status` must not list `mediamtx.yml` as modified")
also gave a false failure whenever the file had legitimate uncommitted edits.

**Fix:** `tar xzf mediamtx.tar.gz mediamtx` (binary only) and `curl -f`; the proof is a
checksum taken before extraction and checked after.

### #27 — The documented venv package list was incomplete

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** README §4, LAUNCH.md A4.

README's `pip install` omitted `WSDiscovery` (imported by `onvif_discovery.py`) and `lxml`,
so the admin GUI and discovery could not import.

**Fix:** `boto3 awsiotsdk onvif-zeep-async WSDiscovery flask requests lxml`; verified by
importing all 17 adapter modules against the venv.

### #28 — Troubleshooting advised `-j2` for the OpenSSL build crash

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** guide §15.

The troubleshooting row "Build dies around OpenSSL/curl → `make -j4` on 4 GB — use `-j2`"
contradicted §4.2's own finding: the outer `-j` never reaches the nested build (#2).

**Fix:** the row now points at patch 1 and names the `Terminated signal … cc1` symptom.

### #29 — The guide never downloaded `AmazonRootCA1.pem`

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** guide §6.4.

`agent.py`'s MQTT connection uses `AmazonRootCA1.pem`, but the guide only downloaded
`SFSRootCAG2.pem` (the credentials endpoint's CA). A fresh setup had no MQTT CA.

**Fix:** both downloads in guide §6.4 and LAUNCH.md A7, with a proof for each endpoint.

### #31 — cam-02's RTSP credentials were committed in `mediamtx.yml`

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** LAUNCH.md E3, CLAUDE.md, guide §16.2.1.

cam-02 was kept alive across MediaMTX restarts (#32) by hardcoding its path in the
tracked `mediamtx.yml` — camera IP, user and password in the `source:` URL — and the file
was pushed to GitHub (commit `aaf04bd`).

**Fix:** `mediamtx.yml` has no camera paths; addresses and credentials live only in the
registry (`rtspUrl`) and a 0600 local cache (#32). **Still required:** change the
camera's password — it remains in git history — then Re-register cam-02 (LAUNCH E3).

### #32 — API-added MediaMTX paths vanished on every MediaMTX restart

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** guide §16.2.1, LAUNCH.md E2/E3, CLAUDE.md.

The admin GUI adds a registered camera's path through MediaMTX's API, and MediaMTX never
writes API changes back to `mediamtx.yml`. Every MediaMTX restart therefore dropped every
GUI-registered camera until someone clicked Re-register — the reason for #31.

**Fix:** `adapter/sync_mediamtx_paths.py` as `ExecStartPost=` of `kvs-mediamtx.service`:
after every start (automatic crash restarts included — a separate unit ordered after
MediaMTX would miss those) it adds each passthrough camera's path from the registry, or
from a 0600 cache when AWS is unreachable; it never deletes a path and leaves unchanged
ones alone. Verified by `kill -9` on MediaMTX: the path was back after the automatic
restart.

### #35 — MediaMTX's generated `auto.crt`/`auto.key` were not git-ignored

**Found:** 2026-09-25. **Referenced from:** LAUNCH.md A5, `.gitignore`.

MediaMTX v1.20 generates a self-signed certificate and private key (`CN=mediamtx`) in
`mediamtx/` on its first start. `auto.key` was ignored only by the generic `*.key` rule;
`auto.crt` not at all — it would have gone into the next commit.

**Fix:** both named explicitly in `.gitignore`.

### #38 — Instructions that failed when followed literally

**Found:** 2026-09-25, reading every current document against the system and against each
other. **Referenced from:** guide §2.8, §4.1, §7.3, §16.6, §17, LAUNCH.md Part B/C/F,
README.

Most of what the review found was drift — statements the system had outgrown, fixed in
place without an entry. These are the ones that *break something* when a reader follows
them as written:

- **Guide §4.1 installed `gstreamer1.0-omx-generic`**, which does not exist on Debian
  trixie, so the whole `apt install` failed. LAUNCH A3 and README had dropped it; the guide
  had not.
- **Guide §7.3 restarted the agent with `sudo systemctl restart kvs-agent.service`**, but
  `kvs-agent` is a *user* unit: the system manager has no such unit, so the proof step
  restarted nothing (the very next line already used `journalctl --user`).
- **`adapter/bin/awsblock.sh`, the outage simulator LAUNCH Part C prescribes, needs
  `iptables`/`ip6tables`**, which a fresh Raspberry Pi OS image doesn't have (it ships
  `nft` only). Nothing said to install it; the old Pi had it from an earlier session.
- **Guide §2.8's `kvs-mediamtx` unit lacked the `ExecStartPost=` path sync**, so a reader
  building units from the guide rather than LAUNCH A8 got MediaMTX with no camera paths
  (#32). §16.6 enabled template instances by camera ID (`kvs-cam@cam-01`) where the real
  ones are named by path (`kvs-cam@cam01`) — #37's mix-up, in the docs.
- **LAUNCH Part B never enabled `kvs-outage-buffer`/`kvs-outage-uploader`**, while Part C
  checked that both were running and README's start list enabled them. Part F and README
  stopped only `kvs-cam01`/`kvs-cam02`, leaving GUI-registered producers billing.
- **Twelve references to a `COSTS.md` that doesn't exist**, with v1.3's section numbers
  and figures ($4.13/month, "4.7×, near 700 cameras") that COSTS-1.4 had revised.

**Fix:** each corrected where it appears — package dropped, `systemctl --user`, an
`apt install iptables` step in LAUNCH Part C, pointers from the guide's historical units
and code listings to LAUNCH A8 and the current code, the outage units in Part B, `stop
'kvs-cam*'` in Part F and README, and every `COSTS.md` reference remapped to
`COSTS-1.4.md`'s sections and figures.

### #39 — The outage supervisor crash-looped on a Pi without the USB stick

**Found:** 2026-09-25, verifying LAUNCH Part B on the second Pi. **Referenced from:**
`outage_buffer.py`.

`kvs-outage-buffer` showed `activating`, not `active` — 80 restarts. At startup,
before its loop ever called `buffer_ready()`, `main()` created `OUTAGE_DIR` to scan for
orphan captures. With the stick not set up (LAUNCH.md A10), `/mnt/vms-buffer` didn't exist,
and creating it needs root: `PermissionError`, exit, `Restart=on-failure`, repeat. The
design says a missing stick means *idle, disarmed* — the sentinel check exists for exactly
that — and the docs promise the outage units idle unless enabled; the one unguarded line
ran first. `is-active` alone would not have shown it: the state word was `activating`,
and only the restart counter and the journal told the story.

**Fix:** nothing touches the buffer until `buffer_ready()` passes; the orphan scan runs
once, on the first ready tick, and readiness changes are logged ("buffer unavailable (not
mounted) -- idle …"). Verified on the Pi without a stick (active, no restarts) and with a
simulated stick appearing mid-run (ready logged, one orphan capture reported once).
(`outage_uploader.py` was already gated on `buffer_ready()`.)

### #40 — cam-01 never published: `gstreamer1.0-rtsp` missing from the setup lists

**Found:** 2026-09-25, "cam01 does not provide video" on the second Pi. **Referenced
from:** LAUNCH.md A3, README §3, guide §4.1.

`kvs-camera-publish` had restarted 167 times: `WARNING: erroneous pipeline: no element
"rtspclientsink"`. Camera detection worked; the element that publishes into MediaMTX did
not exist, so `rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/cam01` was a 404 and nothing downstream had a source.
`rtspclientsink` ships in `gstreamer1.0-rtsp`. Only guide §2.4 installed it; LAUNCH A3's
package list — the one a fresh Pi is set up from — and README §3 did not. (`rtspsrc`, what
the producers use to *read* from MediaMTX, is in `plugins-good`, so they were unaffected.)

It survived the Phase 2 hardware test because that test ran `publish-cam01.sh`'s exact
pipeline with the sink swapped for a local file (MediaMTX wasn't installed yet): the one
element missing was the one the test replaced. A test that substitutes a component proves
nothing about that component.

**Fix:** `gstreamer1.0-rtsp` (and `v4l-utils`) in LAUNCH A3 and README §3, and
`gst-inspect-1.0 rtspclientsink` in A3's proof. Verified: publisher `active` with a stable
restart count, MediaMTX `cam01` ready, H.264 High 1280×720, decoded frame correct.
